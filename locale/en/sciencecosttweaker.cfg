sct-difficulty-cost=Applies multipliers to the cost of technology, based on what "Tier" of science it is.\n\nlolwhat : Everything x0.01.\nUberWaffe : Mil x2, Prod x2, High x5.\nNormal : T2 x2, T3 x4, Mil x4, Prod x4, High x6.\nExtended : T2 x4, T3 x6, Mil x10, Prod x10, High x20, Inf x25.
sct-military=Determines when military research is available.\n\ntier2 : Default, available from tier 2 lab (green,red,military)\ntier3 : Available from tier 3 lab (all except space, hightech)
sct-bio=Determines when angels bio token research is available.\n\ntier1 : Available from tier 1 lab (red,bio)\ntier2 : Default, available from tier 2 lab (read, green, bio)
sct-lab-scaling=Enables scaling of lab base research speed depending on lab tier\nlab 1 - speed 1, lab 2 - speed 1.1, lab 3 - speed 1.3, lab 4 - speed 1.5 (speed is still affected by research speed technonology).
sct-tier1-lab=Prototype for tier 1 lab\nsct-lab-t1: Default, custom tier 1, intermediates might be affected by other mods\nlab: Vanilla recipe, might be affected by other mods
sct-lab-modules=Tier at which module slots are enabled\nnone: Default, no module slots\ntier3:1 slot tier 3, 2 slot tier 4\ntier 4: 2 slot tier 4
